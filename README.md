## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### Screenshots

Screenshots will be available here upon completion.

## My Process

### Built With 

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)

### Out of Scope

I've decided that remotely maintaining user cart sessions will be out-of-scope for this challenge, as I am mostly focused on sharpening my front end capabilities. Therefore, cart sessions will only persist in the browser `localStorage` at this stage.
